Our old servers were pretty bad. Bad hardware, slow connections, bad time. We're pleased to announce that we've just achieved a new server upgrade!
We now have over twice the processing power, meaning we can do much more with ReCape. We have a few ideas on where to go next, but the Discord server is always open for suggestions.
Have a lovely day!
